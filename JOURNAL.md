# JOURNAL.md — Living Project Journal

## Project Rule: Living Journal
Every time a significant action is taken (setup, config, code change, deployment, etc.), an entry must be added to JOURNAL.md in the repo.
Each entry should include:
- Date and time
- Author (if multiple people)
- Description of the action/decision
- Any relevant context, issues, or next steps
When the AI assistant pauses to ask for user confirmation or input, it will also update the journal with a summary of the current state and pending decision.
The journal serves as a living changelog, decision log, and project history.
