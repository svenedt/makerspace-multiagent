# JOURNAL.md — Living Project Journal

## Project Rule: Living Journal
Every time a significant action is taken (setup, config, code change, deployment, etc.), an entry must be added to JOURNAL.md in the repo.
Each entry should include:
- Date and time
- Author (if multiple people)
- Description of the action/decision
- Any relevant context, issues, or next steps
When the AI assistant pauses to ask for user confirmation or input, it will also update the journal with a summary of the current state and pending decision.
The journal serves as a living changelog, decision log, and project history.

- Decided to make robust error handling and graceful failure a foundational requirement for all agents, LLMs, and workflows from the very beginning of the project.

## 2024-05-10 18:00 UTC — Steven Fett
- Decided to create a series of living documentation files to support system planning, onboarding, and maintenance:
  - Agent Template
  - Agent Registry
  - Workflow Templates
  - Security Policy
  - Monitoring & Alerting Plan
  - Onboarding Guide
- Will approach and write each document one at a time, returning to update and expand as the system evolves.

## 2024-06-10 UTC — AI Assistant
- Reviewed the 2024-06 Security & Code Audit Report and compared its recommendations to the current roadmap, checklist, and policies.
- Determined there are no conflicts; audit recommendations are compatible and fill implementation gaps.
- Updated ROADMAP.md and PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md to explicitly include audit-driven milestones and checklist items for production readiness.
- Next steps: Track these items as required deliverables and reference them in all relevant design and implementation discussions.
