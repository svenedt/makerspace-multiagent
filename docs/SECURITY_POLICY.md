# Security Policy

This document outlines the security best practices and requirements for the makerspace-multiagent system. All contributors and administrators must adhere to these policies to ensure the safety, privacy, and integrity of the system and its data.

---

## Access Control
- Principle of least privilege: Each agent, LLM, and user only has access to the minimum resources required for their role.
- Role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC/ABAC) should be used where possible.
- Separate credentials and permissions for each agent/service.

## Credential Management
- Store all secrets, API keys, and credentials in secure locations (e.g., environment variables, Docker secrets, Vaultwarden).
- Never commit secrets to version control.
- Rotate credentials regularly and document the process.
- Use unique credentials for each agent/service.

## Network Segmentation
- Isolate public-facing, internal, and privileged agents/services using VMs, containers, and network segmentation (e.g., VLANs).
- Only allow necessary communication between segments (e.g., via orchestrator APIs).
- Restrict direct access to databases and sensitive services.

## Agent Permissions
- Define and document permissions for each agent using the Agent Template and Registry.
- Never share credentials between agent levels.
- Enforce access control at the API, database, and workflow levels.

## Audit Logging
- Log all privileged actions, agent creations, escalations, and sensitive data access.
- Store logs in a secure, centralized location with restricted access.
- Regularly review logs for anomalies or unauthorized actions.

## Incident Response
- Define and document procedures for responding to security incidents (e.g., credential leaks, unauthorized access).
- Escalate incidents to the appropriate human/admin for review and remediation.
- Document all incidents and responses for future review and improvement.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
- Require explicit human approval for high-impact, sensitive, or irreversible actions.
- Log all HITL approvals and decisions.

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and update security policies as the system evolves.
- Conduct periodic security audits and penetration tests.

# Audit-Driven Implementation Milestones (2024-06)

The following milestones, identified in the 2024-06 Security & Code Audit Report, are now tracked in ROADMAP.md and PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md and are required for production readiness:
- Runtime HITL enforcement and approval logging
- Runtime RBAC/ABAC checks for agent/tool/workflow execution
- Separate audit logs for privileged actions, approvals, and escalations
- Explicit escalation paths in code
- Integration with external monitoring/alerting systems
- Automated security and error handling tests
- Review and documentation of Docker/VM network isolation
