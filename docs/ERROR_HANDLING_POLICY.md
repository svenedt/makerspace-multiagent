# Error Handling & Graceful Failure Policy

## Overview
Building robust error handling and graceful failure into every agent, LLM, and workflow is essential for system reliability, user experience, and maintainability.

## Best Practices
- **Error Handling in Every Agent/Workflow:**
  - Catch and handle exceptions at every step (API calls, DB queries, LLM responses).
  - Return structured error messages, not just "fail" or "None."
- **Fallbacks and Retries:**
  - Define fallback agents, LLMs, or workflows for critical tasks.
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- **Escalation Paths:**
  - If an agent or LLM fails repeatedly, escalate to a human or higher-level agent.
  - Log all escalations for review.
- **User-Facing Messaging:**
  - Provide clear, friendly error messages to users.
  - Never expose stack traces or sensitive info.
- **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Log all errors, retries, and escalations in a central system.
  - Set up alerts for repeated or critical failures.
- **Circuit Breakers:**
  - Use circuit breaker patterns for external APIs or LLMs to prevent overwhelming a failing service.
- **Health Checks:**
  - Regularly check the health of agents, LLMs, and MCPs.
  - Automatically remove or restart unhealthy components.
- **Audit and Review:**
  - Periodically review failure logs and user feedback to improve error handling and system resilience.

## Sample Graceful Failure Flow

```plaintext
Agent/LLM tries task
   |
   v
Success? -----> Yes -----> Continue workflow
   |
   v
No
   |
   v
Retry? -----> Yes (retry with backoff, up to N times)
   |
   v
No
   |
   v
Fallback available? -----> Yes (try fallback agent/LLM)
   |                          |
   v                          v
No                        Success? -----> Yes -----> Continue
   |                          |
   v                          v
Escalate to human/admin   No
   |
   v
Log error, notify user/admin, provide clear message
```

## Actionable Steps
- Add error handling and fallback logic to all agent/LLM templates and workflows from day one.
- Document error handling and escalation policy in the repo.
- Set up centralized logging and alerting early.
- Regularly review and improve error handling based on logs and user feedback.
