# Project Vision & North Star

> **Anchorage Makerspace AI Orchestration** aims to create a secure, modular, multi-agent system that automates operations, unifies data, and enforces human-in-the-loop (HITL) controls for all sensitive actions. The system is designed for auditability, least privilege, and robust error handling, with a clear path to production readiness and future expansion.

# 2024-06 Security & Audit Update

> **As of June 2024, production readiness requires the implementation of audit-driven milestones:**
> - Runtime HITL enforcement and approval logging
> - Runtime RBAC/ABAC checks for agent/tool/workflow execution
> - Separate audit logs for privileged actions, approvals, and escalations
> - Explicit escalation paths in code
> - Integration with external monitoring/alerting systems
> - Automated security and error handling tests
> - Review and documentation of Docker/VM network isolation
>
> These requirements are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`, `SECURITY_POLICY.md`, and the 2024-06 `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`.

________________________________________
1. Introduction & Background
Anchorage Makerspace relies on multiple digital platforms—Fabman for membership and equipment management, HubSpot for CRM and marketing, Slack for member communication, and email for inbound inquiries. As the Makerspace grows, staff and volunteers are inundated with repetitive tasks:
•	Checking membership status, answering Slack questions, sending monthly usage reports.
•	Handling training, door-code creation, and special access requests.
•	Keeping track of which members are behind on dues, who's scheduled for training, etc.
Goal: Build an AI-driven orchestration system—with multiple specialized "agents"—that automates routine tasks, answers questions, and streamlines interactions among staff, members, and external services. One "super agent" can oversee and create new sub-agents or workflows, upon explicit approval from the Makerspace owner or board members.
________________________________________
2. High-Level Objectives
1.	Unify Data
o	Mirror data from Slack, Fabman, and HubSpot in a local "shadow" database for quick queries, offline analytics, and a single source of truth.
2.	Automate Routine Tasks
o	Respond to common Slack queries,
o	Send membership updates and monthly usage reports,
o	Manage door codes after verifying membership status.
3.	Multi-Agent Structure
o	A "frontline" Slack agent with limited permissions,
o	One or more "manager" or "safe-check" agents for board-approved, privileged actions,
o	A "super agent" with owner-level authority to spin up new workflows, set RAG data, and even onboard new employees.
4.	RAG for Historical Knowledge
o	Use Retrieval Augmented Generation so the AI can reference historical Slack messages, emails, membership documents—without loading huge text corpora into every conversation.
5.	Security & Approvals
o	Ensure no destructive or privacy-invasive action occurs without explicit admin or board approval.
________________________________________
3. System Architecture
3.1 Unraid Server Infrastructure
•	Unraid serves as the central platform for hosting multiple VMs and Docker containers.
•	Dual A4500 GPUs are available for AI/LLM containers, though the orchestrator VM may not need direct GPU access if we run GPU-based tasks in separate containers.
3.2 VMs, Docker Containers, and Network Layout
A recommended layout:
1.	MCP VM
o	Already built, hosting or integrating with Fabman, HubSpot, Slack connectors, etc.
o	May store some data locally or rely on external services.
o	Could be locked down with minimal external internet access for security.
2.	Orchestrator VM
o	Runs n8n (or Node-RED) for workflow automation: triggers, schedules, error handling, and API calls.
o	Communicates with the MCP VM, Slack, HubSpot, and AI/LLM containers.
3.	Data Storage VM (Optional but recommended)
o	Hosts a relational database (e.g., MariaDB or Postgres) as the "shadow" DB, plus possibly a Redis instance for caching.
o	Eases backup, snapshot, and security segmentation.
4.	AI/LLM Containers
o	Possibly run on the Unraid host with GPU passthrough.
o	Provide a local API endpoint (e.g., "http://unraid-host:5000") that the orchestrator or agent system can call for text generation or RAG queries.
5.	Vector Database (for RAG)—like Qdrant, Weaviate, or Milvus—running in a container on Unraid.
o	Stores embeddings of Slack messages, emails, documentation.
o	The orchestrator or a dedicated agent queries for relevant snippets at runtime.
________________________________________
4. Core Components
4.1 MCP VM (Membership Control Panel)
•	Home to Fabman data (member statuses, usage logs) or an integration that actively syncs from Fabman.
•	Potentially integrates with HubSpot via API to manage marketing leads, contact records, etc.
•	"Knows" about membership states; might store data locally or forward it to the shadow DB.
4.2 Orchestrator VM (n8n or Node-RED)
•	Visual workflow builder for connecting triggers (Slack message, monthly cron, new email) to actions (database queries, Slack messages, AI calls).
•	Central place to define error handling, logging, and scheduling.
•	Allows manual or automatic triggers for board-approval steps (privileged actions).
4.3 Local "Shadow" Database
•	Consolidates membership data, Slack user IDs/emails, HubSpot contact details, usage logs, etc.
•	Possibly includes Slack message records or email content for retrospective queries or RAG indexing.
•	Facilitates quick queries like "Which members are behind on dues?" or "Give me a usage summary for the last 30 days."
4.4 Slack, HubSpot, Fabman, Email Integration
•	Slack: A bot or app with minimal read/write scopes in public channels, plus DM capabilities for user-specific requests.
•	HubSpot: Potentially used for new sign-ups, marketing data, or ticket management.
•	Fabman: Manages membership payments, equipment usage, door-lock triggers, etc.
•	Email: Polled or forwarded into the orchestrator for automated replies, Slack notifications, or logging to the local DB.
4.5 AI/LLM Containers & RAG
•	You may run a local container (e.g., Ollama or other) for GPT-based models on the A4500 GPUs.
•	Over time, a vector DB can be used to store historical Slack/email data, enabling retrieval-based queries or advanced summarization.
________________________________________
5. Multi-Agent Design
5.1 Hierarchy of Agents
1.	Slack-Facing Agent (Frontline Bot)
o	Limited or read-only scope in public channels.
o	Allowed to do basic membership queries, post updates, or respond to FAQs.
o	If a user wants an action (door code, membership upgrade), the agent logs a request in the boardroom channel or calls an internal "safe-check" flow for approval.
2.	Safe-Check / Manager Agents
o	More privileged—can update membership status or create door codes only after board approval.
o	Usually triggered by a Slack message in a private "boardroom" channel.
3.	Super High-Level Agent (Owner Assistant)
o	Only you have direct access.
o	Can spin up new sub-agents, reconfigure system prompts, add documents to the RAG store, and even onboard new employees.
o	Requires your explicit "Yes, do it" before carrying out major changes.
5.2 "Safe Check" and Approval Mechanisms
•	If an agent or user requests a privileged action (issuing refunds, granting door codes, etc.), a boardroom Slack channel or an internal n8n approval step is used to gather a "Yes, proceed" from an admin.
•	The "safe-check agent" then executes the final command with the correct credentials.
5.3 Implementation Approaches
•	Could be coded as separate n8n workflows with different credentials.
•	Or a multi-agent LLM setup (LangChain, AGiXT) in which the safe-check agent and Slack-facing agent are distinct "tools" or "agents" with unique permission sets.
________________________________________
6. Data Flows & Workflows
6.1 Pulling Data From External Services
•	Cron or Webhooks: n8n polls Slack, HubSpot, Fabman, or email IMAP to retrieve new data.
•	Local DB Upsert: Merges new records or updates membership statuses.
•	If Slack user X is found to have a matching email in HubSpot, unify them into one local DB entry.
6.2 Local Merging & Identity Matching
•	Possibly an orchestrator flow that attempts to match Slack user emails with HubSpot or Fabman accounts.
•	If ambiguous, logs a "manual review" request to an admin.
6.3 Action Requests & Approvals
1.	A member DMs the Slack bot: "I've been paying dues for 30 days—can I get a door code?"
2.	The Slack bot checks local DB or calls the membership API → sees "Yes, they're current."
3.	Slack bot posts a short request in #boardroom: "User X wants a door code—approve?"
4.	A board member responds "Approve," triggering a safe-check agent or an orchestrator flow.
5.	The system calls LockState (or relevant door-lock API) to generate a code, updates the DB, and DMs the user.
6.4 Automated Notifications & Reports
•	Monthly or weekly tasks: n8n triggers a workflow that:
o	Queries usage logs in Fabman,
o	Summarizes data (optionally with an LLM or custom script),
o	Posts a Slack message or emails the result to staff.
________________________________________
7. Security & Access Control
7.1 Agent Permissions
•	Each agent is given minimal necessary scope.
o	Slack-Facing Bot can't do membership writes.
o	Safe-Check Agent has membership write access only after board approval.
o	Super Agent can do everything, but only you can command it.
7.2 Boardroom Approval Process
•	Ensures destructive or private actions require a human admin's explicit sign-off.
•	Logged in a database or Slack channel for auditing.
7.3 Credential Storage & Management
•	Store Slack tokens, HubSpot keys, etc., in environment variables, Docker secrets, or a vault (Vaultwarden).
•	The orchestrator reads these securely.
•	The Slack-Facing agent never sees the safe-check or super agent's privileged keys.
7.4 Auditing & Logging
•	Every privileged request is logged with timestamps, requestor, and approver.
•	LLM conversation logs can be stored, though secrets might be redacted.
•	Any major infrastructure changes initiated by the super agent are recorded for traceability.
- **New (2024-06):** The system must enforce runtime HITL, RBAC/ABAC, audit log separation, explicit escalation, and monitoring as described in the audit-driven milestones. All privileged actions and approvals must be logged and auditable. See `ROADMAP.md` and `SECURITY_POLICY.md` for implementation details.
________________________________________
8. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
8.1 Why RAG?
•	Slack messages and emails accumulate quickly.
•	To let the LLM reference historical data ("What was discussed last month about membership changes?"), you'd prefer an efficient retrieval method vs. feeding the entire backlog to the model.
8.2 Storing Slack Messages & Emails in a Vector DB
•	On a daily or near real-time basis, embed new messages/emails and store them with metadata (channel, timestamp, user) in a vector DB (Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, etc.).
•	Substring or chunk them so each record is ~300-1000 tokens for best retrieval accuracy.
8.3 Querying & Summaries
•	When the Slack bot or a staff agent needs historical context, it embeds the query and runs a similarity search in the vector DB.
•	The top relevant snippets get included in the LLM's prompt, allowing it to "see" prior conversations or policies without scanning the entire DB.
________________________________________
9. Data Retention & Archiving
9.1 Storing vs. Summarizing Older Data
•	Slack channels can accumulate thousands of messages. Maintaining them all can consume storage.
•	You can choose to store everything or adopt a time-based retention (e.g., 6-12 months of raw text, older content is summarized or archived).
•	The vector DB can also be pruned or re-embedded with summaries to save space.
9.2 Compliance & Privacy Considerations
•	If members request data deletion, you must remove them from your DB and vector store.
•	Consider any local laws about storing user conversations or personal data.
________________________________________
10. Scalability & Maintenance
10.1 Error Handling & Recovery
•	If a workflow fails (Fabman API offline, Slack rate-limits), n8n logs it and can post an error message to an admin.
•	Potentially automate solutions or let an "upper agent" fix syntax/prompt issues.
•	Use VM or container snapshots on Unraid for quick rollback if a major break occurs.
10.2 Backup & Snapshot Strategy
•	Keep daily/weekly snapshots of the database VM or orchestrator VM for DR (disaster recovery).
•	Archive logs or large data sets to cheaper storage if needed.
10.3 Future Expansion
•	Web Portal for staff to see membership info, Slack logs, or analytics.
•	SSO integration (Google, HubSpot, or custom) for staff login.
•	Additional Agents for marketing, event planning, or specialized tasks.
- **New (2024-06):** Automated security and error handling tests, as well as monitoring/alerting integration, are required for production readiness. See `ROADMAP.md` for actionable steps.

11. Conclusion & Next Steps
11.1 Summary
We've outlined a multi-agent orchestration system that:
1.	Unifies membership and communications data in a local DB,
2.	Runs orchestrations (in n8n/Node-RED) for Slack-based Q&A, monthly reporting, door code generation, etc.,
3.	Implements an approval-based "safe-check" mechanism to avoid unauthorized changes,
4.	Supports a "super agent" with higher-level permissions to create or reconfigure sub-agents on demand,
5.	Employs RAG so the LLM can reference large historical text without enormous prompt sizes.
11.2 Next Steps
1.	Set Up Orchestrator (n8n/Node-RED) and minimal flows for Slack → Local DB → Email.
2.	Implement Sync with Fabman and HubSpot, storing key membership data locally.
3.	Create Slack-Facing Bot with read-limited scopes, plus an approval mechanism for door codes.
4.	Add RAG by spinning up a vector DB container and embedding Slack messages for prototypes.
5.	Build the Super Agent with a private interface (only you can access). Integrate it with orchestrator tools to create new workflows or sub-agents upon your command.
6.	Document Everything in GitHub or other version control. Keep logs, backups, and versioned workflows for easy rollback.
Over time, you'll refine roles, permissions, and expansions—eventually giving you a robust, secure, and flexible AI ecosystem to manage Anchorage Makerspace with greater efficiency.

Postscript
By hosting everything on Unraid—with multiple VMs and Docker containers—you'll maintain control over your data and can scale or reorganize easily. You'll avoid vendor lock-in to untrusted external services. A GitHub repository can store:
•	This textual "white paper,"
•	Workflow JSON exports,
•	Any code or scripts for advanced agent logic.
From here, you can either:
•	Start building prototypes (perhaps a minimal Slack → n8n → DB flow),
•	Spin up local LLM containers for testing RAG,
•	Or flesh out the "super agent" concept as a specialized microservice with the ability to read and write orchestrator configurations.
The plan is modular: tackle each phase step-by-step, always keeping the final vision of a multi-layer, well-permissioned AI environment in mind—one that lowers staff workload, centralizes data, and supports smooth operations at Anchorage Makerspace.


Below is a sequential roadmap that outlines how to gradually build your multi-agent orchestration system. Each phase has clear objectives, along with prerequisites for the following steps. This ensures you tackle the project in a logical order, with each stage building upon the last.
________________________________________
Roadmap: Anchorage Makerspace Multi-Agent Orchestration
Phase 1: Foundation & Environment Setup
1.	Unraid Server Preparation
o	Verify Unraid is up to date.
o	Confirm dual A4500 GPUs are recognized by the NVIDIA driver plugin.
o	Plan network configuration (bridged or host mode) for the upcoming VMs and Docker containers.
2.	Create / Validate VMs
o	MCP VM: Confirm it's running Ubuntu (or another Linux distro). Ensure it's up-to-date.
o	Data Storage VM (optional in this phase):
	Install a relational database (e.g., MariaDB or Postgres).
	Configure backup/snapshot routines on Unraid for this VM.
o	Orchestrator VM:
	Spin up an Ubuntu (or similar) VM for n8n/Node-RED.
	Install Docker & Docker Compose if needed.
3.	Set Up Basic Orchestrator (n8n or Node-RED)
o	Deploy n8n via Docker on the Orchestrator VM.
o	Configure baseline security (username/password, SSL, etc.).
o	Create a test workflow or two to confirm it's operational (e.g., a simple "Hello World" schedule).
Outcome: A stable foundation with a working Orchestrator VM, an MCP VM, and optionally a Data VM ready for the next steps.
________________________________________
Phase 2: Data Integration & Local DB
1.	Database Setup
o	If not done in Phase 1, install MariaDB/Postgres on the Data Storage VM.
o	Create a database schema (e.g., makerspace_db) for membership/users/Slack data.
o	Add at least one table for "users" or "members," anticipating further expansions.
2.	Sync Core Membership Data (Fabman / HubSpot → Local DB)
o	In n8n, create a pull workflow (Cron or scheduled) that fetches membership/contacts from Fabman or HubSpot.
o	Map/insert that data into the local DB.
o	Confirm you can read records in the DB after a successful pull.
3.	Slack Integration (for minimal data)
o	Register a Slack bot/app if not already done.
o	In n8n, set up a Slack node to listen for relevant events or poll Slack user info.
o	Store Slack user data (email, Slack ID) in the local DB for cross-referencing.
Outcome: You now have a "shadow" DB with membership and basic Slack user info, automatically updated on a schedule or via triggers.
________________________________________
Phase 3: Basic Workflows & Automation
1.	Slack Bot for Basic Queries
o	In n8n, create a workflow that listens for Slack slash commands or mentions.
o	Parse user queries and respond with local membership data.
o	Example: "/membership @john" → The bot looks up John's status in the local DB and posts a summary.
2.	Monthly Reporting Workflow
o	Cron-based n8n flow that:
	Queries the local DB (or Fabman directly for usage data).
	Summarizes membership usage.
	Emails or posts to Slack channel a monthly report.
o	Test with smaller intervals (e.g., daily) until stable, then set to monthly.
3.	Error Handling & Notifications
o	Configure a global error workflow in n8n to catch failures and notify an admin (in Slack or email).
o	Log each error in the DB for auditing.
Outcome: You have working automations that query the local DB, respond in Slack, and produce scheduled reports—laying the groundwork for more advanced agent logic.
________________________________________
Phase 4: Agent Role Separation & Approvals
1.	Safe-Check / Manager Agent Concept
o	Implement a two-stage approach for privileged actions.
o	Workflow 1: Slack user requests an action (e.g., "Grant door code"). The orchestrator checks membership, posts a message in a private Slack channel (#boardroom).
o	Workflow 2: Waits for an admin's "Approve" message in #boardroom. On approval, executes the final action (call LockState API, update membership, etc.).
2.	Credential Segregation
o	The main Slack-facing agent (frontline bot) has minimal read/write tokens.
o	The "safe-check" workflow uses a separate environment variable or credential that can do membership writes, door-code generation, etc.
o	This ensures the frontline bot can't do privileged tasks without the second agent's token.
3.	Approval Logs
o	Write a record to the local DB each time an action is approved and executed (timestamp, user, action detail).
Outcome: A secure multi-agent or multi-workflow structure—frontline bot for user queries, and a safe-check flow for privileged tasks requiring admin approval.
________________________________________
Phase 5: Intro to LLMs & RAG
1.	LLM Container Deployment
o	Spin up a Docker container running Ollama or another GPU-based local LLM (or use external providers via OpenRouter).
o	Test basic calls from n8n to the LLM (e.g., "Summarize this text").
2.	Vector Database Setup (for RAG)
o	Deploy a Qdrant or Weaviate container.
o	Create a "slack_messages" index (or "namespace").
3.	Ingestion Flow (Slack & Email)
o	In n8n, create a scheduled job that:
	Fetches recent Slack messages or emails,
	Splits them into chunks,
	Calls an embedding API (external or local),
	Stores vector embeddings + metadata in the vector DB.
4.	RAG Query Flow
o	Another workflow that, on user request or agent need,
	Embeds the question,
	Queries the vector DB,
	Retrieves top relevant chunks,
	Sends them to the LLM (in "context window") for a final answer.
Outcome: A basic RAG pipeline—historical Slack/emails can be referenced by the LLM, letting your bot do advanced Q&A or summarization.
________________________________________
Phase 6: Hierarchical Agents & The Super Agent
1.	Define the "Super Agent"
o	This agent is only accessible by you, with near-unrestricted authority.
o	Has "tools" or n8n workflows that can, for example, create new workflows, set up new Docker containers, or add entries to the RAG DB.
o	Possibly runs in a LangChain or AGiXT environment with a "manager toolset."
2.	Integration with Orchestrator
o	Provide the super agent an API token for n8n so it can programmatically create or modify workflows.
o	Possibly let it access Docker commands or Terraform scripts if you want it to spin up entirely new containers/VMs.
3.	Approval for Major Changes (Optional)
o	Even though it's your personal agent, you might implement a final "confirm: yes/no?" step to avoid accidents.
o	Log all super agent actions.
Outcome: The super agent can orchestrate everything from a conversation with you—spinning up sub-agents, adjusting system prompts, or migrating data in the RAG DB.
________________________________________
Phase 7: Polishing & Scaling
1.	Web Portal (Optional)
o	Build a simple dashboard (e.g., using Node.js, Python, or a low-code tool) that staff can log into to see membership data, Slack logs, or run manual workflows.
2.	SSO & Authentication
o	Integrate Slack OAuth, Google SSO, or another identity provider if staff or members need a more robust login experience for the portal or certain agent interactions.
3.	Advanced Policies & Roles
o	If you need more nuanced permission layers ("junior admin" vs. "full board member," multi-signature approvals for big refunds, etc.), expand your safe-check workflows.
4.	Data Retention & Summaries
o	Implement a job that archives older Slack messages after X months, or store only summarized versions in the vector DB to manage storage growth.
5.	Monitoring & Observability
o	Possibly integrate a logging/metrics stack (ELK, Grafana, etc.) to watch for performance, API usage, or LLM latency.
Outcome: A mature system with robust user interfaces, authentication, data lifecycle policies, and easy expansions for future needs.

Notes for Usage
Expand: Each phase or step can include more granular tasks, specific credentials, or environment variable details.

Edit: You can easily modify the JSON keys, rename phases, or merge tasks if your environment differs.

Parse: Another LLM or automated system can read this JSON, iterate over phases, or transform the tasks into code or CLI commands.

## Conclusion & Next Steps
- **New (2024-06):** Production readiness is contingent on completion of all audit-driven milestones. These are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`, `SECURITY_POLICY.md`, and the audit report. All contributors must reference these documents to ensure alignment with the unified vision and security requirements.
