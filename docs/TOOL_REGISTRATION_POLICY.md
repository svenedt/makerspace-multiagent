# Tool Registration & Approval Policy

This policy outlines the process and requirements for registering new tools/APIs in the makerspace-multiagent system. All tools must be reviewed, documented, and approved before being made available to agents or LLMs.

---

## Registration Process
1. **Proposal:** Submit a request to add a new tool, including its purpose, endpoint/command, required role, and example usage.
2. **Documentation:** Complete a Tool Registry entry (see `TOOL_REGISTRY.md`) with all required fields.
3. **Security Review:**
   - Assess the tool for security risks (input validation, permissions, data exposure).
   - Ensure the tool enforces least privilege and logs all actions.
   - Designate whether HITL (human-in-the-loop) approval is required.
4. **Approval:**
   - Tool proposals must be reviewed and approved by a project admin or the Admin LLM (with HITL for sensitive tools).
   - All approvals are logged with timestamp, approver, and rationale.
5. **Deployment:**
   - Add the tool to the Tool Registry and make it available via the MCP/API.
   - Announce the new tool to relevant contributors/agents.

## Requirements for New Tools
- Must have clear, descriptive documentation (purpose, usage, permissions, HITL status).
- Must enforce access control and input validation.
- Must log all invocations and results.
- Must be tested for security and reliability before production use.

## HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Designation
- Tools that can impact system state, data integrity, or security must require explicit human approval.
- HITL status must be clearly documented in the Tool Registry.

## Audit & Logging
- All tool registrations, approvals, and invocations are logged for audit and review.
- Regularly review tool usage and update permissions as needed.
