# Monitoring & Alerting Plan

This document describes how system health, agent/LLM status, errors, and performance will be tracked, logged, and alerted in the makerspace-multiagent system.

---

## Monitoring Best Practices
- Monitor all critical components: agents, LLMs, MCPs, databases, orchestrator, and network.
- Track system resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, GPU) for VMs and containers.
- Monitor API response times, error rates, and throughput.
- Collect and store logs centrally (e.g., Loki, ELK stack, or cloud logging).
- Use health checks for all agents, LLMs, and services.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Prometheus:** Metrics collection and alerting.
- **Grafana:** Dashboards and visualization.
- **Loki/ELK:** Centralized log aggregation and search.
- **Custom Health Checks:** Scripts or endpoints for agent/service health.

## Alerting
- Set up alerts for:
  - Agent/LLM/service downtime or unresponsiveness
  - High error rates or repeated failures
  - Resource exhaustion (CPU, RAM, disk, GPU)
  - Security incidents (unauthorized access, credential issues)
- Alerts should be sent to:
  - Admins (email, Slack, or preferred channel)
  - Escalation contacts for critical failures
- Use alert thresholds and escalation policies to avoid alert fatigue.

## Logging
- Log all errors, warnings, and critical events with timestamps and context.
- Store logs in a secure, centralized location with restricted access.
- Retain logs for a defined period (e.g., 6â€“12 months) for audit and review.

## Review & Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review monitoring dashboards and alert history.
- Conduct post-incident reviews for major failures or outages.
- Update monitoring and alerting policies as the system evolves.
