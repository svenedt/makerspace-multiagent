# Agent/LLM Spin-Up Policy

## Who Can Spin Up New Agents/LLMs?
- Only the Admin LLM (Super Agent) is authorized to create new agent or LLM sessions.
- All agent/LLM creation actions are logged and, for sensitive or high-impact tasks, require explicit human approval.

## LLM/Agent Selection Criteria
- The Admin LLM must select the most appropriate LLM for the task based on:
  - Performance: Speed, accuracy, and reliability.
  - Cost: API usage cost, compute resources.
  - Security: Data sensitivity, compliance requirements.
  - Specialization: Domain expertise (e.g., code, research, summarization).
  - Temperature/Settings: Adjusted for the task (e.g., low temperature for research, higher for creative tasks).
  - Availability: Current load, uptime, and API health.

## Configuration Options
- The Admin LLM can configure:
  - Temperature: Controls randomness/creativity.
  - Max tokens: Controls response length.
  - Model version: Selects the best model for the job.
  - Prompt engineering: Customizes instructions for the agent/LLM.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Requirements
- For high-impact, sensitive, or irreversible actions, the Admin LLM must:
  - Request explicit human approval before execution.
  - Present a summary of the planned action, agent/LLM selection, and configuration.
  - Log all decisions and approvals.

## Audit & Logging
- Every agent/LLM creation, configuration, and action is logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - Initiator (Admin LLM, human, etc.)
  - Task description
  - LLM/agent selected and configuration
  - Approval status (if required)

## Example Policy Statement

> The Admin LLM will always select the most appropriate LLM or agent for a given task, referencing real-time rankings (e.g., OpenRouter), cost, speed, and security requirements. For any sensitive or high-impact action, the Admin LLM will require explicit human approval and log all decisions. Configuration (temperature, model, etc.) will be tailored to the task, and all actions will be auditable.
